# Twitter Data Analysis
In this Project I am going to analyze the data from twitter i would collect the data from twitter and do a sentimental analysis. I have used Java Language code to write Map-reduce job, Flume for data collection and HiveQL to analyze and generate report.

Sentiment analysis is the analysis of peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes and
emotions in relation to entities like individuals, products, events, services, organizations and topics by
classifying the expressions as negative / positive opinions.

In this project you i be trying to do sentiment analysis of the opinions on twitter using Hadoop Eco-
System. The reason i chose twitter is because the social media is gaining popularity for the customer
reviews and it is also creating a good business-customer relationship in the market. The reviews would
certainly reflect the service of the company in the market.

Objectives:

The objective of the project is to find the sentiments of the users on Twitter. Companies can analyze the
sentiments of the users regarding their products / services and use it for betterment of the same.

Plan of work:

Collect Data: The initial step is to collect all twitter tweets.
Pre-process Data: I need to write MR job to pre-process the data
Classification of Data: Write Hive UDF for the classification of the data into positive / negative
opinions
Print Data: Final stage would be to print the desired results with the number of good and bad
tweets collected.

Architecture: I have followed below architecture to analyze the data from twitter and generated report.                     


    [user](user tweets about his opinion or feedback on twitter) ---------> [Twitter] (Twitter stores tweets in Json format) ---------->[Apache Flume Server](Flume uses twitter4j API to connect to the twitter streaming API which gives constant stream of tweets. from here flume will start writing data into HDFS) ---pre-processing is done by mapreduce------> [Hadoop Cluster] ----------->[Hive](used hive UDF for classification and queries for reporting) ------------>[Report Generated from hive output]
